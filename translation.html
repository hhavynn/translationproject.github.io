            <td>
                At Xunyang River's head, I bid farewell in the night,<br>
                Autumn leaves and reeds rustle, a scene so right.<br>
                Master dismounts, guest boards the boat's flight,<br>
                Raises his cup, but no music for delight.<br><br>
                
                Drunk, we fail to part with merry hearts,<br>
                Departing amidst the moonlit river, vast.<br>
                Suddenly, the sound of a pipa breaks the spell,<br>
                Master forgets to return, guest remains as well.<br><br>
                
                Inquiring quietly about the musician's name,<br>
                As the pipa's sound halts, speech is tame.<br>
                Boats draw near, inviting an encounter keen,<br>
                Adding wine, relighting the lamp, the scene serene.<br><br>
                
                With countless calls, the musician finally appears,<br>
                Clutching his pipa, partly veiling his fears.<br>
                Strings plucked thrice, melody not yet formed,<br>
                Each note resonates with emotions warmed.<br><br>
                
                Strings suppressed, each sound whispers woes,<br>
                Echoing a lifetime of unfulfilled throes.<br>
                Brows low, fingers swift, melodies unfold,<br>
                Telling tales of untold struggles, never told.<br><br>
                
                Gently plucking, gradually strumming,<br>
                From the Nishang to the Liu Yao, becoming.<br>
                Thick strings sound like a downpour's grace,<br>
                Thin strings whisper secrets in a private space.<br><br>
                
                Clattering, rustling, a cacophony of sound,<br>
                Large and small pearls on a jade tray found.<br>
                Amidst the sound, nightingales murmur near,<br>
                Subdued murmurs, streams under moonlight clear.<br><br>
                
                The water's coldness, the strings freeze,<br>
                Silenced, the music temporarily at ease.<br>
                In this silence, hidden sorrows breed,<br>
                Now, silence triumphs, surpassing any need.<br><br>
                
                Silver vase shatters, water splashes high,<br>
                Iron knights emerge, swords and spears fly.<br>
                As the melody concludes, hearts are moved,<br>
                Four strings resonate, like silk, they're grooved.<br><br>
                
                East boats, west ferries, silent they glide,<br>
                Only the autumn moon gleams, a guide.<br>
                Contemplating, plucking, amidst the strings' lay,<br>
                Tidying attire, preparing to bid the day.<br><br>
                
                Admitting, once, a lady of the capital proud,<br>
                Now residing near Xiami Hill, unbowed.<br>
                At thirteen, mastered the pipa's art,<br>
                Ranked first in the imperial court's chart.<br><br>
                
                After performances, praises showered so well,<br>
                Yet adorned, Autumn Beauties envied her spell.<br>
                Youths from the Five Ridges vie for her affection,<br>
                Countless times, red silk spun, beyond perception.<br><br>
                
                Jade combs, cloud hairpins, beat in rhythm bold,<br>
                Scarlet skirts swirl, stained with wine gold.<br>
                This year's laughter, next year's mirth,<br>
                Autumn moon, spring breeze, an endless birth.<br><br>
                
                Brother joins the army, aunt passes away,<br>
                With each sunrise, sunset, colors gray.<br>
                Before the door, deserted, carriages few,<br>
                Elder sister married, a merchant's wife, true.<br><br>
                
                Merchants value profit, lightly they part,<br>
                Last month, floating beams, tea to depart.<br>
                Coming and going, at the river's mouth waits,<br>
                Moonlit river, chilly, navigates.<br><br>
                
                Deep in the night, youthful dreams revive,<br>
                Dreaming, tears mix with rouge, hearts strive.<br>
                I hear the pipa sigh with deep regret,<br>
                Echoes of sorrow, each note wet.<br><br>
                
                Both exiles, in this world's distant land,<br>
                Meeting now, need not recognize where we stand.<br>
                I, from last year, bid the capital goodbye,<br>
                Banished, to bedridden Xunyang I did comply.<br><br>
                
                Xunyang, remote, devoid of melody's grace,<br>
                Year after year, no sound of strings to trace.<br>
                Near Pian River, lowlands damp and chill,<br>
                Yellow cottages, bamboo thickets, my will.<br><br>
                
                At dawn and dusk, what do I hear,<br>
                Cuckoos crying, gibbons wailing near.<br>
                In spring, flowers bloom, autumn's moon bright,<br>
                Often taking wine, returning alone, a silent plight.<br><br>
                
                Without mountain songs or village flutes in ear,<br>
                Hoarse laughter, difficult to hear.<br>
                Tonight, hearing your pipa's gentle strains,<br>
                Like celestial music, my senses regain.<br><br>
                
                Do not refuse to play another tune,<br>
                For you, I'll pen another "Pipa Tune."<br>
                Moved by my words, you stood for a while,<br>
                But as you played, the strings' pace did compile.<br><br>
                
                Sorrowful, unlike the sounds of yore,<br>
                In the crowd, tears flowed, not just one, but more.<br>
                Whose tears fell most in this gathering's array?<br>
                Jiangzhou's magistrate, his blue robe, now gray.<br><br>

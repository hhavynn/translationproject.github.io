            <h2>google translated for fun:</h2>
            <p>The Xunyang River sees off guests on the first night, and the maple leaves and flowers rustle in autumn.
                The master dismounted and was on board the boat. He wanted to drink wine, but there was no orchestra.
                It's too late to be drunk and happy to say goodbye. When we say goodbye, the vast river is soaked in the moon.
                Suddenly I heard the sound of pipa playing on the water, and the host forgot to return home.
                Xun Sheng asked secretly who was playing the pipa, but the sound of the pipa stopped and it was too late to speak.
                Move the boat closer to invite us to meet each other, add wine, turn back the lights, and resume the banquet.
                After calling for thousands of times, he came out, still holding the pipa and half covering his face.
                There are three or two sounds of the strings being plucked by the rotating shaft, and there is emotion before the tune is formed.
                The strings muffle the sounds and thoughts, seeming to complain of failure in life.
                The formalities of the letter were continued with a low eyebrow, telling all the endless things in one's heart.
                Pick it up lightly, slowly pick it up and then pick it up again. It is a colorful dress at first and then six pieces.
                The big strings are as noisy as the rain, and the small strings are as loud as whispers.
                The bullets are noisy and mixed, and big and small beads fall on the jade plate.
                The orioles in Guan Guan are talking at the bottom of the flowers, and the spring water is flowing down the beach.
                The water spring is cold and the strings are condensed, and the condensation will never pass the sound for a while.
                Don't worry and hate yourself. Silence is better than sound at this time.
                The silver vase was broken, water slurry burst out, and the cavalry stood out with swords and guns.
                At the end of the song, the plectrum is carefully drawn, and the four strings sound like cracking silk.
                The east boat and the west boat are silent, only the white autumn moon can be seen in the middle of the river.
                While he was chanting and plucking strings, he straightened his clothes and started to attract customers.
                She said that she was originally a girl from the capital city, and her family lived under the tomb of shrimp.
                At the age of 13, he learned the pipa successfully and became the first member of the teaching group.
                Qu Ba often teaches talented people how to dress well and make up so that Qiu Niang is jealous of her.
                The young people in Wuling are struggling with their heads, and there are countless red silk songs.
                The head of the tin is shattered by the grate, and the bloody skirt is stained by wine.
                This year's laughter will bring back the next, and the autumn moon and spring breeze will pass easily.
                The younger brother joined the army and the aunt died, and the twilight passed away and the dynasty came back.
                The front door is deserted and there are few cars and horses. The boss is married to a businessman.
                Businessmen value profit over separation. The month before last, they went to Fuliang to buy tea.
                The boat is empty at the mouth of the river, and the moon is shining brightly around the boat. The river is cold.
                Late at night, I suddenly dreamed about my youth. I cried and cried, and my eyes were red with tears.
                I sighed when I heard the pipa, and I groaned again when I heard the words.
                We are both fallen people at the end of the world, so why should we have known each other before.
                I resigned from the imperial capital last year and was relegated to Xunyang City where I was sick.
                There is no music in Xunyang, a remote place, and the sound of silk and bamboo is not heard all year round.
                I live near the Huanjiang River, where the land is low and humid, and the Huanglu Bamboo grows around my house.
                In the meantime, I heard something at dawn and dusk, the cuckoo crows and the blood ape moans.
                On a spring river with flowers facing the autumn moonlight, I often drink wine alone while drinking.
                How can there be no folk songs and village flutes, which are hard to listen to?
                Tonight, hearing your pipa music makes my ears suddenly bright as if listening to fairy music.
                Mo Cigeng sat down to play a piece of music and translated it into a pipa line for you.
                I feel that I have been saying this for a long time, but sitting down makes the strings turn sharply.
                It's so sad that it's not like the forward sound, and everyone in the house weeps when they hear it again.
                Who cried the most in the audience? Sima Jiangzhouâ€™s green shirt was wet.</p>
